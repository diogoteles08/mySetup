# Welcome! :wave:
This is the home (and by this I certainly mean `~/` hehe) setup I usually use, which compiles some configurations for VIM and BASH.

# Key Features
- Enables Vim [Pathogen](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332), which makes it easy to add plugins to vim by just adding them to `~/.vim/bundle/`
    - The setup already comes with a few plugins enabled
- Enables vim key-bindings on bash terminal
- Makes Vim's default yank and paste point to the system's clipboard

# Usage
Add the files to your home directory:
```
cd /~
git init
git remote add https://github.com/diogoteles08/mySetup
git pull
```
